## Usage
> For more use-cases see the [tests](test.js)

```js
const dushBetterUse = require('dush-better-use')
```

## API

### [betterUse](index.js#L37)
> Overrides the default [dush][]/[minibase][]/[base][] `.use` method to support named plugins and to have better error handling. It also adds/registers the [minibase-is-registered][] plugin if not included already, so you will have `.isRegistered` method too. This plugin emits `error` event if something fail in plugin, instead of throwing.

**Params**

* `opts` **{Object}**: no options currently    
* `returns` **{Function}**: a plugin function that should be passed to `.use` method  

**Example**

```js
var dush = require('dush')
var betterUse = require('dush-better-use')

var app = dush()
app.use(betterUse())
```

### [.use](index.js#L89)
> Calls `fn` plugin immediately once, if `name` is string it registers it as "named" plugin so you can find its name at `app.registered` cache. It also emits `error` event if plugin `fn` throws.

**Params**

* `name` **{String|Function}**: name of the plugin or `fn` plugin function    
* `fn` **{Function|Object}**: a plugin function, called immedately; or `options` object    
* `options` **{Object}**: direclty passed as 2nd argument to `fn`    
* `returns` **{Object}**: self "app" for chaining  

**Example**

```js
var called = 0

function plugin (app) {
  app.foo = 123
  called++
}

app.use('foobar', plugin)
app.use('foobar', plugin)
app.use('foobar', plugin)

console.log(called) // => 1
console.log(app.foo) // => 123
console.log(app.registered) // => { 'foobar': true }

// if something fails in a plugin
// it emits `error` event
app.once('error', (err) => {
  console.log('ERR!', err.toString()) // => Error: sadly error
})
app.use((app) => {
  throw new Error('sadly error')
})
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue][open-issue-url].  
Please read the [contributing guidelines][contributing-url] for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io][codementor-url] too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md][changelogmd-url] and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
